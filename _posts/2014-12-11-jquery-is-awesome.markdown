jQuery is awesome.

It is easy to learn because of its great API and documentation.

jQuery opened the door to many people who were initially intimidated by programming.

It fixed a ton of cross-browser issues, allowing developers to focus on other things.

And it is terse to write.

But we have grown up a little. We may not need it anymore. We may be ready to ride Unicorns bareback like magical warriors. If we wanted, we could wield only core JavaScript and reap these benefits:

* Our apps and pages can benefit from better performance
* A better understanding of what frameworks are made of
* The opportunity to dig deep into a flexible, amazing languge
* To be able to talk about objects, properties, methods, constructors, module patterns, callbacks, prototypal inheritance, the functional context of this, and tons of other really, really smart stuff
